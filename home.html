            <div class="caption">Intermediate, We were a group of nine, but the three of us became something more — a bond that was like love ❤️. Hema, when you parted ways with Bakka hema, I never considered including you in our bench initially. Honestly, I was reluctant because it already seemed cramped with three 😁. But now that I look back, I can't even imagine how incomplete it would have been without you. You added an extra dash of laughter, madness, and complete joy to our lives. <br>

                Those two years, which I will never forget, were all about a certain number of endless battles — from furious debates and laughs with 2B Sir and Bhanu Sir to those very last-minute exam panic study sessions. But through everything, we remained united, stronger and closer with each day. From fighting in classes to planning trips, from silly jokes to honest heart-to-hearts, every minute became a precious memory. <br>
                
                You both brightened up my days, lightened my problems, and made our friendship stronger. Wherever life may lead us, all these experiences will forever be stored in my heart as the best days of my life 🥰.</div>

But still, when we’re together, I forget all my worries… because you always make me smile. It's okay if you roast me—sometimes I secretly enjoy it, 'because I’m the reason behind your smile 😉.
                I’m a bit jealous though😁… you two exploring Bangalore without me. I somehow wished those trips got cancelled 😤😂 But it’s okay—let’s plan more adventures together, try all kinds of food, and talk until our mouths literally shut down!🤓</div>
