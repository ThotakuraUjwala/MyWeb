        <h1>Hey,,,,,,,,I can't express how much you both mean to me. No matter the situation, you've always stood by my side, adding shine to my life. Thank you for making my life beautiful with your memories and endless talks. From our intermediate days to now, it's been seven years of togetherness—how can I sum up all those moments in just a few words?🫣<br>

            Maybe I can't express it fully, but I love you both so much🤗 and never want to lose you. I know I may hurt you sometimes, but I also love winning arguments with you 😜. And finally, you both are like an adapter and cable to my me 🤭—you keep me charged.</h1>
